# WP Find Shared Terms

[Read this for background](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/02/16/taxonomy-term-splitting-in-4-2-a-developer-guide/).

As of WordPress 4.2, whenever a shared term is updated it will be split. This is an issue for any plugins or themes that store term IDs as they may change. This plugin will detect any shared terms in your WordPress install and list them along with the taxonomies they belong to.

Once activated, navigate to the **Tools > Find Shared Terms** menu to see any shared terms.
